What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It acts as a bridge, enabling one application to request data or services from another.

Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant:

You (the client) order food by asking the waiter.
The waiter (the API) takes your order to the kitchen.
The kitchen (the server) prepares the food and gives it to the waiter.
The waiter brings the food back to you.
In this analogy:

You = the application making the request (client).
Waiter = the API.
Kitchen = the backend system (server).
APIs are widely used in web development to enable interactions between clients (like web browsers or mobile apps) and servers.

What is an API Request?
An API request is a message sent by a client to an API, asking it to perform an action or return data. It typically includes:

Endpoint (URL): The address of the API youâ€™re trying to access.
HTTP Method: The type of action the client wants to perform. Common methods include:
GET: Retrieve data.
POST: Send data to the server (e.g., to create a new resource).
PUT: Update an existing resource.
DELETE: Remove a resource.
Headers: Additional information like authentication tokens, content type, etc.
Body (optional): Data sent with the request (usually for POST or PUT requests).
Example of an API Request
Scenario: A weather app wants to display current weather for a location.
API Endpoint: https://api.weather.com/v1/current
Request:
Method: GET
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
Parameters: ?location=NewYork&unit=celsius
API Response
After processing the request, the API sends back a response, which could include:

Status Code: Indicates success (e.g., 200 OK) or failure (e.g., 404 Not Found).
Data: The requested information (e.g., temperature, humidity).
APIs simplify the process of integrating different systems, enabling faster and more efficient application development.
