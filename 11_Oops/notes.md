# Javascript and Classes

Yes, JavaScript does have classes, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). However, JavaScript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance system. This means they provide a more readable and familiar structure for object-oriented programming but work under the hood using prototypes.

# What Are JavaScript Classes?
Classes in JavaScript are special functions that define a blueprint for creating objects. They encapsulate data and functionality and support features like inheritance.

## OOPS --> Programming paradigm (style of writing program)
- Object --> collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase , Promise is also object as we are using new keyword

## Why use OOPS ?
 - Parts of OOPS
   Object literal, constructor function, prototype, classes, instances (new, this)

## 4 imp keywords --> 
- Abstraction -- hide complex details and show only necessary parts of an object
- Encapsulation -- wrapping or bundling data
- Inheritance -- one class to reuse or extend the properties and methods of another class.
- Polymorphism -- multiple works using one method. It allows methods to behave differently depending on the object calling them.
