// Asynchronous Code -- Foundation

// JavaScript --> Synchronous (one code executed then next is executed) + Single threaded (slow comparatively but work by delegating)
// Execution Context --> execute one line of code at a time

// each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

++++ BLOCKING CODE vs Non-BLOCKING CODE ++++++

Blocking code --> block the flow of program (Read File Sync)
Non-Blocking code --> does not block execution --> (Read File Async)

// both are good depending on the use case

Js Engine (Memory heap + Call Stack) =====> Web API / Node Environment(inside browser)

Task Queue --> Promise (High priority queue)

// During async code --> Web API -- set timeout / set interval / DOM API -- REGISTER CALL BACK --> add to queue
which is further added to call stack

New API --> fetch() --> Promise (to execute later, it has same callbacks)
